# STM32

In this repository there are code snippets for the STM32 driver development.
On the original project i used as Dev Tools : uKeil vision version 5, CLion as IDEs and also the STM32CubeMX for code generation.
There were implemented the hal drivers which were generated using the STM32CubeMX tool and also a buffered - uart driver which was handler -based.
The boards used in the original project development were : STM32F3DISCOVERY and STM32F1DISCOVERY
